I noticed you advertising the Data Engineer position on twitter, and am pleased to submit my resume for the position.  I have spent the last three years helping people collect, store, chop up and understand their data.  Continuing this work, surfacing data to help people reach their customers in a way that is less frustrating for everyone, would be a privilege.

If there is anything about my resume that I want to highlight, it is the teaching experience.  For years my job was to show up every day and communicate information, context and stakes in a way that empowered students.  Today I use this to talk simply, coherently and technically to stakeholders. More specifically, I was communicating the benefits of statistics to novices.  If Motiva.ai needs to convince experts why statistics can help them do their job, I can help you do that.

Finally I hope to embody many of the characteristics you talk about in the final paragraph of your job posting.  As an unstoppable lifelong learner, I am currently taking a [networking course](https://lagunita.stanford.edu/courses/Engineering/Networking-SP/SelfPaced/about), reading two books to shore up my vim knowledge, and sitting on a lifetime of learning resources that I am optimistic about getting to soon.  I am helping friends and acquaintances start their python skills, and am signed up to start teaching introductory python at Noisebridge soon, all of which definitely keeps me humble.
